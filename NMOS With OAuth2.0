## Introduction

This document presents the modifications / changes to the AMWA/NMOS IS-10 and BCP-003-02 specifications in Matrox NMOS Node devices implementing OAuth2.0 authentication.

The AMWA/NMOS IS-10 and BCP-003-02 specifications are overly generic and complex for implementation across all device classes. In particular, the overhead associated with these specifications, as currently written, is too demanding for smaller devices. This document proposes a balanced approach, offering a compromise between full specification support and the practical need for managing read/write access authorizations to NMOS APIs of an NMOS Node.

An NMOS Node configured to perforn OAuth2.0 Bearer token validation on its NMOS API endpoints implements, as a Resource Server, the modified specification. An NMOS Node is not expected to behave as an OAuth2.0 Client, the NMOS Registry registration API being expected to be secured by TLS client/server certificates only.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Definitions

The NMOS terms 'Controller', 'Node', 'Source', 'Flow', 'Sender', 'Receiver' are used as defined in the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/main/docs/Glossary.html).
