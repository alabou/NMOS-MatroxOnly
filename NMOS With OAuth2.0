## Introduction

This document presents the modifications / changes to the AMWA/NMOS IS-10 and BCP-003-02 specifications in Matrox devices implementing OAuth2.0 authentication.

The AMWA/NMOS IS-10 and BCP-003-02 specifications are overly generic and complex for implementation across all device classes. In particular, the overhead associated with these specifications, as currently written, is too demanding for smaller devices. This document proposes a balanced approach, offering a compromise between full specification support and the practical need for managing read/write access authorizations to NMOS APIs of an NMOS Node.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Definitions

The NMOS terms 'Controller', 'Node', 'Source', 'Flow', 'Sender', 'Receiver' are used as defined in the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/main/docs/Glossary.html).

## Behaviour

### Time Synchronization

Authorizations are not meant to be provided for short periods of time. An authorization is expected to be delivered for a complete work day of 12 hours. The requirements on the clock used by the various sub-systems (OAuth2.0 authorization server, NMOS Controller, Nmos Node, etc) of the NMOS system is then relaxed. A sub-system is not required be capable of synchronizing their clocks to an external source of time. A sub-system's estimation of the true time MUST be within 30 minutes of the true time.
